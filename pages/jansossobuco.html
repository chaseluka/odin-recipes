    <p style="text-align: center;">Jan Levinson is the former Vice President of North East Sales at Dunder Miflin, but now works as a candle maker and stay at home trophy girlfriend to Michael Scott.
        Jan enjoys meeting with her therapist, interior design, and dancing to her favorite song, "That One Night" by The Hunted (Jan's former assistant). Jan is also a fantastic host as she loves making her guests feel uncomfortable and hungry so that she can swoop in and be the hero by saving the day with a fantastic dish of Osso Buco.
